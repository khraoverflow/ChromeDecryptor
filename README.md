# ChromeDecryptor
 Gather Chromium based browsers saved passwords without dropping additional DLLs

- outputs passwords and key with which we can decrypt passwords which are encrypted in AES GCM ( the point is to not do that on victim machine, rather do it on our end for reasons xD)

# todo:
- add support for other browsers
- decrypt cookies
